## Goals for this blog

1. Quickly setup - want to start outputting content quickly
1. Minimal & handspun - want to start simple and add features as I see fit
1. Learning opportunity / project - a little challenge for myself
1. Design project - want to have complete control over the styling of the blog because that's fun for me
