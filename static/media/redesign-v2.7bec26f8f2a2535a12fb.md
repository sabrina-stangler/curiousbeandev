# Big design change

After getting feedback from the wonderful Tomohiro Loeer (Tomo) and the incredible Kate Pociask, I've made a significant change to my home page.

## Reflecting on the purpose

I want people to see this and 1) hire me as a product consultant, 2) hire me as a design thinking consultant, 3) book me to speak, &/or 4) learn more about me and realize how cool I am.

## Process Thoughts

I just tossed something out for my home page where I outline my services, but I'm not quite happy with it. Tomo suggested that I incorporate more of a story element in and try to give it the "sab pizzazz". I'm proud of the graphics I created to represent each service, but it still feels very lame overall.

Jumping back in after a few months of sitting on this PR ... I'm just going to send it. Feeling like I need to take my own advice and ITERATE! I can't iterate if I don't release anything or get feedback. I am also getting over the fear of having a website that isn't 100% perfect. Yes, this is a tool to sell my time, but I'm selling my product expertise overall, not exclusively my website design chops.

# Result

* [x] I made cute little graphics to represent my services, and I'm really proud of them

Truthfully, I am not sure yet how to include images in my blog posts (which are markdown files). It's been a big enough barrier that I haven't been able to figure it out with a few hours, so I've put it on the back burner for now in favor of getting blog posts & changes out sooner. It's my goal to include images in future blog posts where I make design changes. Until then!
